Wee
House

The
Wee house will not be conventional in the sense that there will be very little
lot clearing, and with the small footprint it will leave the lot as natural as
possible. There will not be driving on the lot, the Wee house will have a
walkway that will wind up the hill, and since we aren't leveling the lot, we
wont need flood insurance. This keeps our insurance cost to a minimum. The
total amount needed to fund this project is $ 100,000

Financials
:

Income
~ 200 days @ $ 225 = $ 45,000

Cost
of the lot = $ 1350 per month or $16,200 per year

Interest
= $ 100,000 @ 8% =$ 670 per month or $ 8000 per year

Insurance
= $ 125 per month or $1500 per year 

Utilities
= $ 200 per month or

$2400

Total
Positive cash flow = $ 16,900
