The
Wee House

The Wee house, with green building in mind, looking to
reuse and repurpose materials that are left over from building large homes in a
environmentally critical area, but would not be limited, to just this area, and
could be used anytime there is leftover material on the job site, whether it's a
remodel job or new construction, the benefits to this project, is the use of
leftover building material which will lessen the destruction of forest and the
filling of landfills, as well as the expense should be less. The Wee house,
would be small in physical size, but big in quality of living. The plans are
included in this email. The Wee house will be built to be as maintenance free,
and as energy-efficient as possible.

These will have
environmentally friendly items like, metal roofs, and would use rain storage to
provide water to the landscaping, and passive solar energy to maintain all
exterior lighting, all walkways will be permeable, preventing runoff . this
will allow the owners of these homes to live in a carefree environment and have
a minimum carbon footprint while also benefitting on the low cost of the
original purchase as well as the low cost of maintaining a Wee house. Hopefully
it will also allow the local municipalities to look at a higher density of
houses, on property, rather than the giant houses, which allow so many people
in a house, allowing for more community
living.

The first Wee
house will be built on the sound front lot in a maritime forest, this lot is
owned by Jim Douglas and due to the unique nature of this Wee house there will
be no conventional financing available,
this will be a model, and it will be made from as much recycled and repurposed
lumber and materials as possible. 

Do to the fact that there wont be any conventional
financing,I will be seeking funds from private individuals between $1000 and
$5000 I will pay 8% interest annually for three years, at the end of the third
year the principal payment, plus the
interest for the year will be paid in full. I am also looking for people to
work with me, on the house and they will earn 8 % on there billed labor, this
will allow me to build the house with less out of pocket expenses. These loans
are unsecured, but with the equity that is already in the land I feel
comfortable there shouldn't be a problem. 

The Weehouse will come with all the amenities such as
beach cruisers, kayaks, standup paddleboards, so it will be everything they
need to enjoy the Outerbanks, they won't have to rent anything, so it's kind
like an all-inclusive rental I think this would be very appealing. in with that
in mind my rental projections are attached.
